# About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web applicatio

# Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

`Database Tables`
1- Users
2- Properties
3- Bookings
4- Payments
5- Reviews

# üèÜ Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# API Security
Public APIs will have one or all of the following security measures (authentication, authorization, rate limiting). API security is crusial for such an app.
Without robust security measures user data "Personal data, credit cards, bookings, etc" will never be save from exploitation.

# CI/CD Pipeline
Robus CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery)
To make sure that the software is  built, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably
